The {name-mission-secured} booster provides a default HTTP endpoint that accepts `GET` requests if the caller is authenticated and authorized.
The client first authenticates against the {RHSSO} server and then performs a `GET` request against the {name-mission-secured} booster using the access token returned by the authentication step.
