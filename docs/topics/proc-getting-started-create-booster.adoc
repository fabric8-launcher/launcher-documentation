= Creating and Deploying a Booster Using {OpenShiftOnline}
You can quickly create, build, and deploy a booster to {OpenShiftOnline} using the {launcher} application. The {launcher} application creates a new repository in your GitHub account containing the booster's code and deploys it to your {OpenShiftOnline} account. It can also create a ZIP of the booster for you to download and run on your localhost.
