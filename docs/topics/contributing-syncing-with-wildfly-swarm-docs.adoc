= Syncing with {WildFlySwarm} Docs

Some documentation files for the {WildFlySwarm} runtime are sourced directly from the {WildFlySwarm} repository.
You must synchronize them manually before a release to ensure the newest version of the files is available.

The synchronization script deletes the existing `$REPO_HOME/docs/topics/wildfly-swarm` directory and replaces it with the latest version of the `master` branch from the upstream repository.
Edit the variables in the `$REPO_HOME/scripts/sync_with_wildfly_swarm.sh` script to customize it.
The variables are documented in the script.

NOTE: Some files are not present in the upstream repository because they are generated. The script automatically builds the upstream project with Maven, ensuring these files are not missing.

WARNING: Do not edit the files in the `$REPO_HOME/docs/topics/wildfly-swarm` directory, always submit a pull request to the upstream repository and synchronize the files when they are updated upstream.
