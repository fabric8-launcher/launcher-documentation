.What {SpringBoot} Does

The {SpringBoot} runtime gives you the advantages and convenience of the OpenShift platform:

* rolling updates
* service discovery
* canary deployments
* ways to implement common microservice patterns: externalized configuration, health check, circuit breaker, and failover
