= Deploying {runtime} application to OpenShift

:parent-context: {context}
To deploy your {runtime} application to OpenShift, configure the `pom.xml` file in your application and then use the Fabric8 Maven plugin.
You can run a standalone application by replacing the `fabric8.generator.from` URL in the `pom.xml` file to specify an OpenJDK image.
