= Interact with the Unmodified {WildFlySwarm} Booster

The booster provides a default HTTP endpoint that accepts GET requests.

. Use `curl` to execute a `GET` request against the booster. You can also use a browser to do this.

$ curl http://{app-name}-{project-name}.192.168.99.100.nip.io/api/greeting
{"content":"Hello World from a ConfigMap!"}
----

. Update the deployed ConfigMap configuration.
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc edit configmap app-config
----

Change the value for the `greeting.message` key to `Bonjour %s from a ConfigMap!` and save the file. After you save this, the changes will be propagated to your OpenShift instance.

. Rollout the new version of your application so the ConfigMap configuration changes are picked up.
