= Running the {parameter-mission-name} Booster Integration Tests

This booster includes a self-contained set of integration tests.
When run inside an OpenShift project, the tests:

* deploy a test instance of the application to the project,
* execute the individual tests on that instance,
* remove all instances of the application from the project when the testing is done.

include::note-integration-tests-app-deletion-warning.adoc[]

.Prerequisites

* the `oc` client authenticated
* an empty project in your OpenShift namespace

ifdef::vert-x,spring-boot[]
* view access permission assigned to the service account of your booster application. This allows your application to read the configuration from the ConfigMap:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc policy add-role-to-user view -n $(oc project -q) -z default
----
endif::vert-x,spring-boot[]

.Procedure

Execute the following command to run the integration tests:

[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
--
$ mvn clean verify -Popenshift,openshift-it
