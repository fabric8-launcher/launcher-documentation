= Deploying an Existing {NodeJS} Application to OpenShift

You can deploy an existing {NodeJS} application to OpenShift using the steps in xref:proc_deploy-new-nodejs-app-openshift[].

In addition, you must verify the following items when deploying an existing application:

* Ensure the `files` section of `package.json` lists all files and directories you need to deploy with your application.
* Ensure the `start` entry in the `scripts` section of `package.json` correctly starts your application.
* Ensure all the ports used by your application are correctly exposed when configuring your routes.
