The {ProductShortName} CRUD application Booster expands on the HTTP API Booster to provide a basic example of performing _create_, _read_, _update_ and _delete_ (_CRUD_) operations on a PostgreSQL database using a simple HTTP API.

The Booster also demonstrates the ability of the HTTP application to locate and connect to a database. Each runtime determines in an opinionated manner to implement the connectivity solution that is best suited in the given case. The runtime can choose between using _JDBC_, _JPA_, or _ORM_.

The Booster application exposes an HTTP _CRUD_ API, which provides endpoints that allow you to manipulate data by performing  _CRUD_ operations over HTTP.
The API uses JSON fromatting to receive requests and return responses to the user.

This Booster does not showcase a fully matured RESTful model (level 3), but it does use compatible HTTP verbs and status.

The Booster introduces the basics of manipulating data stored in a relational database using _CRUD_ operations over HTTP.
Specifically, this Booster provides an application that allows you to:

* Navigate to the application web interface in your browser. This exposes a simple website allowing you to perform _CRUD_ operations on the data in the `my_data` database.
* Execute an HTTP `GET` request on the `api/fruits/*` endpoint.
* Receive a response formatted as a JSON array containing the list of all fruits in the database.
* Execute and HTTP `GET` request on the `api/fruits/*` endpoint while passing in a valid item ID as an argument.
* Receive a response in JSON format containing the name of the fruit with the given ID. If no item matches the specified ID, you will receive an empty JSON document as a response.
* Execute an HTTP `POST` request on the `api/fruits/*` endpoint, passing in a valid ID as an argument, to create a new entry in the database.
* Execute an HTTP `PUT` request on the `api/fruits/*` endpoint passing in a valid index and a name as an argument. This updates the name of the item with the given ID to match the name specified in your request.
* Execute an HTTP `DELETE` request on the `api/fruits/*` endpoint, passing in a valid ID as an argument. This removes the item with the specified ID from the database and returns an HTTP code `204` (No Content) as a response. If you pas in an invalid ID, the call results in an HTTP error `404`.

This Booster also contains a set of automated xref:crud-integration-testing[integration test] that can be used to verify that the application is fully integrated with the database.
