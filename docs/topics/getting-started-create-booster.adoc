IMPORTANT: This steps requires you to login using Red Hat Developers account.

. Choose your deployment type.
. Follow the instructions to create a booster of your choice.

The _Deploy in OpenShift Online_ option creates a new GitHub repository containing your booster and launches it to {OpenShiftOnline} while _Build and Run Locally_ creates a ZIP containing your booster that you can download to build and run locally.

Both options also provide a `README.adoc` file with details on building, deploying, and interacting with your booster from your local host.
