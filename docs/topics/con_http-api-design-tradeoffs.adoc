|====================================================================
|Pros           |Cons
a|
* The example enables fast prototyping.
* The API Design is flexible.
* HTTP endpoints allow clients to be language-neutral.
a|
* As an application or service matures, the {name-example-http-api} approach might not scale well. It might not
support a clean API design or use cases with database interactions.
** Any operations involving shared, mutable state must be integrated with an appropriate backing datastore.
** All requests handled by this API design are scoped only to the container servicing the request.
Subsequent requests might not be served by the same container.
