= ${mission} - ${runtime} Booster

[IMPORTANT]
====
While you can run and interact with this booster on localhost, it requires that you also have a cache server installed and configured. This booster runs best when deployed on OpenShift with a JBoss Data Grid cache server. 
For more details on using this booster with a single-node OpenShift cluster, CI/CD deployments, as well as the rest of the runtime, see the link:${guideURL}[${runtime} Runtime Guide].

== Running the Booster on a Single-node OpenShift Cluster
If you have a single-node OpenShift cluster, such as Minishift or Red Hat Container Development Kit, link:http://launcher.fabric8.io/docs/minishift-installation.html[installed and running], you can also deploy your booster there. A single-node OpenShift cluster provides you with access to a cloud environment that is similar to a production environment.

To deploy your booster to a running single-node OpenShift cluster:

. Navigate to the root directory of your booster.
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ ${gitCMD}

$ cd ${targetRepository}
----

. Log in and create your project.
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc login -u developer -p developer

$ oc new-project MY_PROJECT_NAME
----

. Deploy the cache service.
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc create -f service.cache.yml
----

. Deploy your booster.
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ ${OSORunCMD}
----


== Interacting with the Booster on a Single-node OpenShift Cluster

. Determine the URL of the `greeting` service.
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc get route ${app-name} -o jsonpath={$.spec.host}

${app-name}-MY_PROJECT_NAME.LOCAL_OPENSHIFT_HOSTNAME
----

. Navigate to the `greeting` service using your browser.

. Click _Invoke the service_ once.
+
Notice the `duration` value is above `2000`. Also notice the cache state has changed form `No cached value` to `A value is cached`.

. Wait 5 seconds and notice cache state has changed back to `No cached value`.
+
The TTL for the cached value is set to 5 seconds.
Once the TTL expires, the value is no longer cached.

. Click _Invoke the service_ once more to cache the value.

. Click _Invoke the service_ a few more times over the course of a few seconds while cache state is `A value is cached`.
+
Notice a significantly lower `duration` value since it is using a cached value.
If you click _Clear the cache_, the cache is emptied.
