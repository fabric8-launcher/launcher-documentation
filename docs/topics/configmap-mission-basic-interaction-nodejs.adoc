= Interacting with the Unmodified {Node} Booster

The booster provides a default HTTP endpoint that accepts `GET` requests.

. Use `curl` to execute a `GET` request against the booster. You can also use a browser to do this.
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ curl http://{app-name}-{project-name}.{os-route-hostname}/api/greeting
{"content":"Hello, World from a ConfigMap !"}
----
. Update the deployed ConfigMap configuration.
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc edit configmap app-config
----
+
Change the value for the `message` key to `Bonjour, %s from a ConfigMap !` and save the file.


. Update of the ConfigMap should be read by the application within an acceptable time (a few seconds) without requiring a restart of the application.
. Execute a `GET` request using `curl` against the booster with the updated ConfigMap configuration to see your updated greeting.
You can also do this from your browser using the web form provided by the application.
