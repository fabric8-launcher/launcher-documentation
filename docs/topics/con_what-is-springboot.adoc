= What is {SpringBoot}

{SpringBoot} lets you create opinionated Spring-based stand-alone applications.
See link:{link-spring-boot-guide}#additional-springboot-resources_spring-boot[Additional Resources] for a list of documents about {SpringBoot}.

The {SpringBoot} runtime gives you the advantages and convenience of the OpenShift platform:

* rolling updates
* service discovery
* canary deployments
* ways to implement common microservice patterns: externalized configuration, health check, circuit breaker, and failover
