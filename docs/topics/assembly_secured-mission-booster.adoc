// This is a parameterized assembly. Parameters used:
//
//  parameter-runtime-anchor: Which runtime this assembly is built for. Different from parameter-runtime for routing reasons
//  parameter-runtime: Which runtime to include files for.
//
// Rationale: This assembly is nearly identical for all runtimes.

// Do not change the anchor ID, it is set to this for URL routing reasons

The {name-mission-secured} booster secures a REST endpoint using link:https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-single-sign-on[{RHSSO}^]. (This booster expands on the {name-example-http-api} booster).

{RHSSO}:

* Implements the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_single_sign-on/7.1/html/securing_applications_and_services_guide/openid_connect_3[Open ID Connect] protocol which is an extension of the OAuth 2.0 specification.
* Issues access tokens to provide clients with various access rights to secured resources.

Securing an application with SSO enables you to add security to your applications while centralizing the security configuration.

IMPORTANT:  This mission comes with {RHSSO} pre-configured for demonstration purposes, it does not explain its principles, usage, or configuration.
Before using this mission, ensure that you are familiar with the basic concepts related to link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_single_sign-on/7.1/html-single/getting_started_guide/[{RHSSO}^].
