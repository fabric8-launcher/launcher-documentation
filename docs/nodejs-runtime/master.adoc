== Debugging
This section contains information about debugging your {NodeJS}{ndash}based application and using debug logging in both local and remote deployments.


[#remote-debugging]
=== Remote Debugging 
To remotely debug an application, you need to start it in a debugging mode and attach a debugger to it.

include::topics/proc_debug-start-native-debug-nodejs.adoc[leveloffset=+3]

include::topics/proc_debug-start-v8-debug-nodejs.adoc[leveloffset=+3]


[#debug-logging]
=== Debug Logging

Debug logging is a way to add granular logging to an application that can be explicitly enabled only when performing debugging. This allows you to keep the logging capability in your application and only enable it when needed.
