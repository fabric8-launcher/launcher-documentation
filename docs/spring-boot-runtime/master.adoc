== Developing an application for the {SpringBoot} runtime

The recommended approach for specifying and using supported and tested Maven artifacts in a {SpringBoot} application is to use the OpenShift Application Runtimes {SpringBoot} BOM.

== Managing the configuration of your {SpringBoot} application

include::topics/con_configmap-availability.adoc[leveloffset="+2"]

== Debugging

This sections contains information about debugging your {SpringBoot}{ndash}based application both in local and remote deployments.

=== Remote debugging

To remotely debug an application, you must first configure it to start in a debugging mode, and then attach a debugger to it.
